        <p><strong>Introduction to Data Communication</strong></p>
        <p>Human beings are the only creatures on the earth who are able to communicate with each other through the medium of language. But humans take this gift to another extent. Distance, time, and physical existence of the person donâ€™t matter in communication these days because they build a communication system through which they can communicate or share data like images, videos, text, files, etc with their loved ones anytime anywhere.</p>

        <p>Communication is defined as a process in which more than one computer transfers information, instructions to each other and for sharing resources. Or in other words, communication is a process or act in which we can send or receive data. A network of computers is defined as an interconnected collection of autonomous computers. Autonomous means no computer can start, stop or control another computer.</p>

        <p><strong>Components of Data Communication</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Message:</strong> A message is a piece of information that is to be transmitted from one person to another. It could be a text file, an audio file, a video file, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Sender:</strong> It is simply a device that sends data messages. It can be a computer, mobile, telephone, laptop, video camera, or workstation, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Receiver:</strong> It is a device that receives messages. It can be a computer, telephone mobile, workstation, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Transmission Medium / Communication Channels:</strong> Communication channels are the medium that connect two or more workstations. Workstations can be connected by either wired media or wireless media.</li>
            <li><strong>Set of rules (Protocol):</strong> When someone sends the data (The sender), it should be understandable to the receiver also otherwise it is meaningless. For example, Sonali sends a message to Chetan. If Sonali writes in Hindi and Chetan cannot understand Hindi, it is a meaningless conversation.</li>
        </ul>
