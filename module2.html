    <h1>Module-1: Compiler Design</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>What is Compiler Design?</strong></p>
        <p>The compiler is software that converts a program written in a high-level language (Source Language) to a low-level language (Object/Target/Machine Language/0, 1â€™s).</p>

        <p>A translator or language processor is a program that translates an input program written in a programming language into an equivalent program in another language. The compiler is a type of translator, which takes a program written in a high-level programming language as input and translates it into an equivalent program in low-level languages such as machine language or assembly language.</p>

        <p>The program written in a high-level language is known as a source program, and the program converted into a low-level language is known as an object (or target) program. Without compilation, no program written in a high-level language can be executed. For every programming language, we have a different compiler; however, the basic tasks performed by every compiler are the same. The process of translating the source code into machine code involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, and optimization.</p>

        <p><strong>Types of Compilers</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single Pass Compilers:</strong> When all the phases of the compiler are present inside a single module, it is simply called a single-pass compiler. It performs the work of converting source code to machine code.</li>
            <li><strong>Two Pass Compilers:</strong> Two-pass compiler is a compiler in which the program is translated twice, once from the front end and the back from the back end known as Two Pass Compiler.</li>
            <li><strong>Multipass Compilers:</strong> When several intermediate codes are created in a program and a syntax tree is processed many times, it is called Multi pass Compiler. It breaks codes into smaller programs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Computer Network Architecture</strong></p>
        <p>Computer Network Architecture is defined as the physical and logical design of the software, hardware, protocols, and media of the transmission of data. Simply we can say that how computers are organized and how tasks are allocated to the computer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peer-To-Peer network</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Client/Server network</strong></li>
        </ul>
