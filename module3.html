        <p><strong>Basics of Computer Networking</strong></p>
        <p>Computer Networking is the practice of connecting computers together to enable communication and data exchange between them. In general, Computer Network is a collection of two or more computers. It helps users to communicate more easily. In this article, we are going to discuss the basics which everyone must know before going deep into Computer Networking.</p>

    <div class="section-heading">Types of Computer Network Architecture</div>
    <div class="content">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client-Server Architecture:</strong> Client-Server Architecture is a type of Computer Network Architecture in which Nodes can be Servers or Clients. Here, the server node can manage the Client Node Behaviour.</li>
            <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Architecture:</strong> In P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Architecture, there is not any concept of a Central Server. Each device is free for working as either client or server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Computer Network Architecture</strong></p>
        <p>Computer Network Architecture is defined as the physical and logical design of the software, hardware, protocols, and media of the transmission of data. Simply we can say that how computers are organized and how tasks are allocated to the computer.</p>
        <p>The two types of network architectures are used:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Peer-To-Peer network</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Client/Server network</strong></li>
        </ul>
